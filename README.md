# CoPilot
Project for the course *Software Engineering 2* at Mälardalen University.

# Configure the project to start running it:
First of all you need a Firebase account to manage the project so follow the next instructions:

Open http://firebase.google.com/ in your browser -> Click on the blue button "start" -> add project -> choose the name of your project -> accept the terms and create the project.

Next you should select Android app and complete the form with this data: 

Android package name:

	com.mdh.ivanmuniz.copilotapp

Other Name (optional):

	CoPilot

We recomend that you use SHA1, but it is not necessary.

We have to download the configuration.

Copy configuration in this folder CoPilotApp/app.

Next you will need to open Android Studio, and select "Open an existing Android Studio project". You select the folder named CoPilotApp inside the CoPilot that you have downloaded, and then run the app.

In Firebase's website, we select Authentication from the menu on the left, and then Configure new log in. After that, we select "email/password" and abilitate the option. The second option does not need to be abilitated. Then save.
